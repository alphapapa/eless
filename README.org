#+TITLE: A Better Less

*ShellCheck status:* [[https://travis-ci.org/kaushalmodi/eless.svg?branch=master]]

=eless= is a combination of Bash script and a minimal emacs =view-mode= config.

This script is designed to:

- Be portable -- Just one bash script to download to run
- Be independent of a user's emacs config
- Not require an emacs server to be already running

It was created out of a need to have something /like/ =less= (in the sense of
/launch quickly, do, and quit/, but better in these ways:

-  Do syntax highlighting
-  Render Org-mode files
-  A better navigable man page viewer
-  Dired, especially =wdired= (batch edit symbolic links, for
   example?)
-  Show colored diffs
-  Filter log files to only show or not show lines matching a regexp
-  Start auto-reverting log files when I want (like =tail -f=)
-  Quickly change frame and font sizes
-  .. and more; basically everything that emacs has to offer!

I call it =eless= and here's a little taste of what it looks like:

As a bonus:

- [x] This script passes [[http://www.shellcheck.net][ShellCheck]], and
- [x] Unofficial Bash [[http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode][strict mode]] is enabled.

Try it out!

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
eless -h | eless
#+END_EXAMPLE

/Caveat: While =foo | eless= works, the emacs GUI mode has to be
enforced for that, as emacs does not accept input from STDIN in terminal
mode./
