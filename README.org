=eless= is a combination of Bash script and a minimal emacs =view-mode= config.

This script is designed to:

- Be portable -- Just one bash script to download to run
- Be independent of a user's emacs config
- Not require an emacs server to be already running

It was created out of a need to have something /like/ =less= (in the sense of
/launch quickly, do, and quit/, but better in these ways:

- Do syntax highlighting
- Render Org-mode files
- A better navigable man page viewer
- A better Info viewer
- Dired, especially =wdired= (batch edit symbolic links, for
  example?)
- Show colored diffs
- Filter log files to only show or not show lines matching a regexp
- Start auto-reverting log files when I want (like =tail -f=)
- Quickly change frame and font sizes
- .. and more; basically everything that emacs has to offer!

I call it =eless= and here's a little taste of what it looks like:

As a bonus:

- This script passes [[http://www.shellcheck.net][ShellCheck]], and
- Unofficial Bash [[http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode][strict mode]] is enabled.

* Try it out
Here are some usage examples:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
eless foo.txt               # Open foo.txt in eless in terminal (-nw) mode by default.
eless foo.txt --gui         # Open foo.txt in eless in GUI mode.
echo 'foo' | eless          #
echo 'foo' | eless -        # Same as above. The hyphen after eless does not matter; is anyways discarded.
grep 'bar' foo.txt | eless  #
PAGER=eless man grep        # Launches man pages in eless (terminal mode), if the environment variable PAGER is set to eless.
PAGER=eless man grep --gui  # Launches man pages in eless (GUI mode), if the environment variable PAGER is set to eless.
diff foo bar | eless        # Colored diff!
diff -u foo bar | eless     # Colored diff for unified diff format
eless .                     # Open dired in the current directory (enhanced 'ls')
ls --color=always | eless   # Auto-detect ANSI color codes and convert those to colors
PAGER=eless git diff        # Show git diff with ANSI coded colors
eless -h | eless            # See eless help ;-)
info emacs | eless          # Read emacs Info manual in eless
eless foo.tar.xz            # Read the contents of archives; emacs does the unarchiving automatically
#+END_SRC
